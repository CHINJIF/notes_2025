DATA OBJECTS AND ATTRIBUTE TYPES

7

Data Objects

 Databases/Datasets are made up of data objects.
 A data object represents an entity.

Sales DB: customers, store items, sales
Medical DB: patients, treatments
University DB: students, professors, courses

 Database rows  data objects, described by attributes

 Also called as samples, examples, instances, data points, tuples

 Database columns  attributes

 Also called as data field, characteristic, dimension, feature, variable

8

What is an Attribute?

 A data field, characteristic, dimension, feature, or variable

 To describe an object, e.g., student_ID, name, address, age, …
 The type of an attribute is determined by the set of all possible 

values it can have.

SID

Age

Email

Class

Student

DOB

Address

Name

9

Attribute Type – Nominal

 To represent categories, labels, codes, or “name of things”

 Values DO NOT have meaningful order, but are enumerations.

hair color = {red, black, grey, brown}
marital status = {single, married, divorced}
occupation = {dentist, doctor, programmer}
pets = {dog, cat, bird}

 Values can be numbers, e.g., customer IDs, zip codes, etc.

 NO calculation operations, as NOT quantitative
 NO middle/mean values, as NO ordering

Mode: the attribute’s most commonly occurring value

10

Attribute Type – Binary

 Nominal attributes with only 2 states

 Often use {1, 0} to represent present/absent, positive/negative, 

true/false, etc.

 Symmetric binary: both outcomes equally valuable, e.g., gender

 No preference on which outcome should be coded as 1 or 0.

 Asymmetric binary: outcomes not equally important, e.g., medical 

test (positive vs. negative)
 Convention: code the most important outcome (e.g., HIV positive) by 1, 

and the other by 0.

11

Attribute Type – Ordinal

 An ordinal attribute with possible values that:

 have a meaningful order or ranking among them
 but the magnitude between successive values is unknown.

drink size = {small, medium, large}
education level = {high school, bachelor, master, doctoral}
professional rank = {assistant, associate, full}

 Applications: useful for subjective assessments of qualities that 

cannot be measured objectively
 In surveys for ratings, 0: very dissatisfied, 1: somewhat dissatisfied, 

2: neutral, 3: satisfied, 4: very satisfied

12

Attribute Type – Numeric

 To provide quantitative measurements of an object 

 Type 1: Interval-Scaled

 Ordered values: e.g., 20ºC, 50ºC, 80ºC, …
 Meaningful difference: difference between 2025 and 2015 = 10 years
 Equal-size intervals: difference between 20ºC and 25ºC = that between 

30ºC and 35ºC
 NO True Zero

 0ºC does not mean “no temperature”. The year 0 is not the beginning of time.
 Ratios are meaningless: 20ºC ≠ 2 * 10ºC. 

 Type 2: Ratio-Scaled

13

Attribute Type – Numeric

 To provide quantitative measurements of an object 

 Type 2: Ratio-Scaled

 True Zero: a zero-point represents the absence of the quantity.

 0 word = blank page; 0 kg = no weight; $0 = no money.

 Meaningful ratios: ratios between values can be compared.

 $20 is twice more than $10.

 Categorization

 Count attributes (discrete): # employees, # words in a paper, population
 Measurement attributes (continuous): weight, height, coordinates, money

14

Classify Attribute Types

 To describe a qualitative feature of an object that does not 
provide actual size or quantity – nominal, binary, ordinal
 Values are typically words representing categories.
 Integers are used to embed categories as codes.
 0 for small drink size, 1 for medium, and 2 for large.

 To provide quantitative measurements of an object – numeric

 Interval-scaled: No true zero.
 Radio-scaled: True zero, enabling meaningful ratios.

15

Attribute Types: Discrete vs. Continuous

 Discrete

 Attributes with a finite or countably infinite set of values.

 Finite values

 Nominal: marital status (single, married, divorced), 
 Binary: medical test (positive / negative)
 Ordinal:  profession levels
 Numeric: shoe size, scores, # items sold, # students in a class

 Countably infinite values: infinite values, but can be mapped to natural 
numbers (1, 2, 3, …), e.g., customer ID, serials numbers of iPhones.

 Representation as integer variables: e.g., [0, 100] for age

 Binary attributes are a special case with only two possible values.

16

Attribute Types: Discrete vs. Continuous

 Continuous

 Attributes that can take on real-number values within a range, 

including decimals or fractions
 e.g., temperature, height, weight, length, time, money, stock prices, …

 Uncountably infinite: there are infinitely many possible values 

between any two values
 e.g., between 50kg and 51kg, we have 50.1, 50.2, and so on.

 Typically stored as floating-point variables for precision

 float, double in programming

BASIC STATISTICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF DATA

18

Basic Statistical Descriptions of Data (I)

 Motivation: To better understand the data, identify properties of 
the data, and highlight what values shall be treated as noise
 Central tendency: to measure the middle or center of the data
 Mean: The average of the data (sensitive to extremes/outliers)
 Median: The middle value when data is ordered (a more robust measure 

when data is skewed)

 Mode: The most frequently occurring value

example: a strong 
middle class and fewer 
low-income households, 
e.g., Sweden, Finland, 
Denmark.

example: a small group 
of extremely high-income 
earners and a large 
population of low- to 
middle-income workers, 
e.g., New York, HK

19

Basic Statistical Descriptions of Data (II)

 Motivation: To better understand the data, identify properties of 
the data, and highlight what values shall be treated as noise
 Data dispersion: how are the data spread out?
 Range: difference between max and min values
 Interquartile Range (IQR): Measures spread around the median
 Variance / Standard Deviation: Indicate deviation from the mean

20

Basic Statistical Descriptions of Data (III)

 Motivation: To better understand the data, identify properties of 
the data, and highlight what values shall be treated as noise
 Graphic displays: to visually inspect our data

 Bar Charts: Good for categorical data
 Pie Charts: Show proportions
 Histograms: Display frequency distributions
 Line Graphs: Useful for trends over time

21

Measuring the Central Tendency: (1) Mean

 Mean: the “center” (average) of a data set (algebraic measure)

 A salary data set is {30, 36, 47, 50, 52, 52, 56, 60, 63, 70, 70, 110}. 
 Then, the mean salary is 58 (K dollars).

Weighted mean/average
• Each value in a set may be associated with a 

weight, reflecting the significance, importance, 
or occurrence frequency.

• e.g., income is the most important for loan.

22

Measuring the Central Tendency: (2) Median

 Median: the middle value when data is ordered 
 The middle value if there is odd number of values
 The average of the middle two values otherwise (by convention)

 A salary data set is {30, 36, 47, 50, 52, 52, 56, 60, 63, 70, 70, 

110}. Then, the median salary is 54 (K dollars).
 50% is below 54, and 50% is above 54.

Given the mean is 58 > 54, there are more 
poor people (> 50%) in the set, i.e., more 
people are below average salary.

23

Measuring the Central Tendency: (3) Mode, Midrange

 Mode: the value that occurs most frequently in the data
 Midrange: the average of the largest and smallest values 

 A salary data set is {30, 36, 47, 50, 52, 52, 56, 60, 63, 70, 70, 

110}. 
 Mode: 52 and 70
 Midrange: (30 + 110) / 2 = 70, i.e., the average between the 

richest and poorest income.

24

Symmetric vs. Skewed Data

 Compare the central tendency (i.e., median, mean and mode) 
of symmetric, positively-skewed and negatively-skewed data

*the long tail is on 
the positive side 
(higher values)

25

Measures of Data Dispersion



-Quantiles: 

Q1
data points where the data distribution is split 
equal-size consecutive sets, e.g., 2-quantile (i.e., median), 

into 
𝒒𝒒
4-quantiles (called quartile), 100-quantiles (called percentiles)

𝑞𝑞 − 1

Q3

𝑞𝑞

Interquartile Range (IQR)
•

to identify the spread of the central 
portion of a dataset

• calculated as the difference between: 

• Upper quartile, Q3
• Lower quartile, Q1
• IQR = Q3 – Q1 = 63 – 47 = 16

26

Graphic Displays: Boxplot

 Quartiles (i.e., 4-quantiles)

 Five-number summary: min, Q1, 

median (Q2), Q3, max

 Boxplot: data is represented by a box
 IQR:  the two ends of the box are at Q1 
and Q3, i.e., the height of the box is IQR
 Median: marked by a line within the box 
 Whiskers: two lines outside the box 

extended to min and max

IQR
50%

27

Graphic Displays: Boxplot’s Application

 Outliers

 data points beyond a 
specified threshold
 Usually, outside values are 
higher than Q3 or 

lower than Q1
1.5 × 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼
 Plotted individually

 The whiskers shall stop at 
the most extreme low/high 
observations within 
of the quartile.

 Then, outliers show up.

1.5 ×

28

Graphic Displays: Quantile Plot

 Plot univariate data to assess the overall behavior and unusual

occurrences

 f-value: the cumulative relative frequency or percentile rank

of the data. 

• Values are sorted in increasing order, 

so 

is min, 

is max.

𝑥𝑥1
• For a data 

𝑥𝑥𝑁𝑁
, its f-value 
approximately 
below or equal to 
• 25% of items’ price < $60

𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖

.
𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖 × 100%
𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖

indicates

of the data are 
𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖

29

Graphic Displays: Quantile–Quantile Plot

 To display the quantiles of one univariate distribution against

the corresponding quantiles of another
 View: Is there is a shift in going from one distribution to another?

Comparison:
- Q1: 60 vs. 64
- Q2: 78 vs. 85
- Q3: 96 vs. 100

Unit prices of items sold at 
Branch 1 tend to be lower 
than those at Branch 2.

30

Variance and Standard Deviation

 To measure how spread out a data distribution is:

 data observations tend to be very close to the mean
the data are spread out over a large range of values

 Low 
 High 
𝜎𝜎
𝜎𝜎

 The variance 

of 

observations, 
, for a numeric attribute 

2

is: 

𝜎𝜎

𝑁𝑁

𝑥𝑥1, 𝑥𝑥2, … , 𝑥𝑥𝑁𝑁

𝑋𝑋

 The standard deviation 

is the square root 

of the variance – the spread about mean


𝜎𝜎
only when there is no spread, i.e., all 

observations are the same. 
𝜎𝜎 = 0

31

Graphic Displays of Basic Statistical Descriptions

 Histogram: tabulated frequencies, shown as bars

•
•
•

green: men’s incomes
light purple: women’s incomes
darker purple: incomes for men 
and women overlap

Observations:
• Mode: most common income 
range is from $20,000 to 
$40,000.

• Significant overlap in middle-
income ranges ($40,000 -
$80,000).

• Women’s incomes are 

concentrated in lower ranges 
(<$40,000), while men have 
greater representation in 
higher-income ranges.

Purpose

show the distribution of numerical data

Data Type plot binned quantitative data points

consecutive, non-overlapping bins, by 
dividing the range of data (usually of 
equal width); cannot be reordered

compare different categories or 
discrete groups

plot categorical data, where each 
bar describes a category

the categories being compare; can 
be reordered

the frequency or count of data in each 
bin (a range of values)
touch each other  the data covers a 
continuous sequence.

a specific value for each category, 
e.g., counts, percentages, means
separated by small gaps  the 
categories are distinct

to understand the shape and spread of 
the data distribution, e.g., revealing 
normal distributions

to identify the highest/lowest 
categories or trends over time 
(e.g., years, ages)

Scatter Plots and Data Correlation

 Scatter Plot: the most effective graphical methods to visualize 

bivariate data (data involving two numeric attributes)
 Reveal if there appears to be a relationship, pattern, or trend
 Two attributes are correlated if one attribute implies the other.
 Correlations: positive, negative, null (uncorrelated)

the income vs. the credit limit

the age of the car vs. 
its resale price

34

Pixel-Oriented Visualization Techniques

 To compare attributes

 Each pixel represents a sample.
 The colors of the pixels reflect the corresponding values.

All customers are sorted in an
income-ascending order.
 Credit limit increases with 

income.

 Middle-income group shops 

more frequently.

 No clear correlation between 

income and age.

DATA SIMILARITY AND DISSIMILARITY

37

Similarity – support of knowledge discovery

 To assess how alike or unalike objects are compared to one 

another based on certain attributes
 Depend on the underlying context of applications 
 Useful in classification, clustering, and outlier analysis

 e.g., groups of customers with similar income, age, purchases,…

 It is knowledge to deal with other 

(or new) similar situations.
 Similar problems may have 

similar solutions.

38

Proximity: Similarity and Dissimilarity

 Proximity usually refers to either similarity or dissimilarity.
 Similarity measure

 A real-valued function that quantifies how alike two objects are 

based on their attribute values

 Range: 
 Text matching: “The sky is blue.” vs “The sky is clear and blue.”

, from completely dissimilar to completely similar

 Dissimilarity (or distance) measure: how different they are

[0,1]

 ≈ the inverse of similarity  the lower, the more alike
 Range: 

, depending on the definition

or 

 Minimum dissimilarity is often 0 (i.e., completely similar).

0,1

[0, ∞)

39

Data Matrix vs. Dissimilarity Matrix

 Data matrix (object-by-attribute)

 A data matrix of 
data points (rows) with 
 Used as input for ML models (e.g., regression or classification)

dimensions (columns)

𝑛𝑛

 Dissimilarity matrix (object-by-object)



data points, but registers only the distance

 Distance functions are usually different for different variables.
𝑛𝑛
 Weights can be associated with different variables based on 

𝑑𝑑 𝑖𝑖, 𝑗𝑗

applications and data semantics.

 Usually symmetric, thus a triangular matrix

Proximity Measures for Nominal Attributes

 A nominal attribute takes two or more states, categories, etc.

 Marital status: single, married, divorced, …

 The dissimilarity between two objects 
based on the ratio of mismatches:

and 

can be computed 

•

•

𝑖𝑖
: # matched attributes for which 

objects are in the same state

𝑑𝑑 𝑖𝑖, 𝑗𝑗 = 1

42

Proximity Measures for Binary Attributes

 A binary attribute has only one of two states {0,1}.

 0 means the attribute is absent and 1 means it is present (smoker).
 Treating binary attributes as numeric can be misleading!

 Symmetric (equal state)
table



 Asymmetric (e.g., medical test)
 A positive match is more important

Proximity Measures for Ordinal Attributes

 Must have a meaningful order

 Discrete: year of student = {freshman, sophomore, junior, senior}
 Or discretizing numeric attributes

 HK temperature  cold: [0, 10], walm: [10, 20], hot: [20, 30]
with 

 For an ordinal attribute 

states:

 Replace the value of 

by its rank 
𝑓𝑓

𝑀𝑀𝑓𝑓

 Normalize the rank by mapping onto 

𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓 ∈ 1, … , 𝑀𝑀𝑓𝑓

: 

𝑓𝑓

𝑟𝑟𝑓𝑓−1

 Compute the proximity via methods for numeric variables

𝑀𝑀𝑓𝑓−1

[0, 1]

𝑧𝑧𝑓𝑓 =

i. Rank: {1, 2, 3, 4}
ii. After mapping: [0, 1/3, 2/3, 1]  freshman: 0; sophomore: 1/3; junior: 2/3; senior 1
iii. L1 Distance:  d(freshman, senior) = 1, d(junior, senior) = 1/3
48

Dissimilarity for Attributes of Mixed Types

From Words to Vectors in Documents

 Document Vector or Term-Frequency (TF) Vector

 Structure: A bag of terms or a long vector – each value records 

the frequency of a term (e.g., keyword, phrase) in a doc

 Applications: information retrieval, text document clustering, 

biological taxonomy, gene feature mapping, search engines, …

Cosine Similarity for Documents

 Long and Sparsity Issues: two TF vectors have many 0 values 

 share limited words in common  similar? No!

 Need a measure that focuses on the non-zero matches:

 Shared content: instead of counting zeros, it measures how often 

non-zero words occur together.
 Cosine similarity for two TF vectors:

 Euclidean norm of vector 

: 

 sim = 0  no match
 sim = 1  completely match with each other

Summary

 Data objects consist of datasets, represent entities, and are 

described by multiple attributes. 

 Attributes can be nominal (name of things), binary (symmetric or 

asymmetric), ordinal, or numeric (interval- or ratio-scaled).

 Basic statistical descriptions for initial analytics: mean, median, 

mode, range, quantiles, quartiles, interquartile range (IQR), 
variance, and standard deviation, etc. 

 Graphical representations (e.g., boxplots, quantile plots, scatter 
plots, histograms) and data visualization (pixel-oriented, …)

 Proximity: similarity and dissimilarity (distance)
